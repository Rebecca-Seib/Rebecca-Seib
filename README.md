The projects I have worked on at KSE:

•	I was able to create an app that allowed users to add an item to a sharepoint list, they were allowed to change a current item on the list, sort the list and then delete an item from the list all in PowerApps through Microsoft. 

•	I was able to create an app that allowed users to select what kind of cat they wanted for that day. The app was linked to an API on the internet that generated random cat images or gifs. Users were also able to add a cat to a list. 

•	I created multiple flows in Power automate using the cat app.
o	-The flows I was able to make off the cat app were to modify and add a row to an excel spreadsheet, create a custom email and created an approval for the app. 
While the cat app was only a tester app, I was able to incorporate many components into it.

While in my internship, I used Brainstorm to take trainings on SharePoint, Teams, Power automate, and PowerApps. 

I was able to work on some shared projects as well. These were collaborative with many departments and I was able to work on some projects that were live and front end facing. 

•	The first project I worked on was a Power Bi Data set that took data from a SharePoint list and turned it into visuals. This was for the security credential login. The data showed how many people we checked in that year, the company they were with, the id type they used and how many people on average we had checked in.

•	The second project I helped collaborate on was a live app that helped security check in users. I was tasked with making certain badges display “No building access”. I was successful in this attempt and the project went live after they had me adjust some wording.

•	I collaborated on a project that involved employees asking for VPN access. I had to transform a Word Document into a Microsoft Form, then automate that form to make a new item in a SharePoint List, as well automate an approval. I had the form set up, the first part of the flow working and my supervisor was able to finish the rest of the flow while I was away.

•	I collaborated on another form automation. This one made one form into two forms and had the person fill out the second form after being approved by the manager for the first form. These forms were created off a premade questionnaire in word and were translated into Microsoft Forms. 

•	Another project I was given was to make an outlook calendar auto add a event to the PTO calendar in events whenever someone used the words PTO.

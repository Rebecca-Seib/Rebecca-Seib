The projects I have worked on at KSE:

•	I was able to create an app that allowed users to add an item to a SharePoint list, they were allowed to change a current item on the list, sort the list and then delete an item from the list all in PowerApps through Microsoft.  This was an app that was centered around being able to add/delete and modify a hockey player and their salary. While it was only a sandbox app,  I had the app synchronizing to a SharePoint List. 

•	I was able to create an app that allowed users to select what kind of cat they wanted for that day. The app was linked to an API on the internet that generated random cat images or gifs. Users were also able to add a cat to a list. I created multiple flows in Power automate using the cat app. The flows I was able to make off the cat app were to modify and add a row to an excel spreadsheet, create a custom email and created an approval for the app. While the cat app was only a tester app, I was able to incorporate many components into it.

While in my internship, I used Brainstorm to take trainings on SharePoint, Teams, Power automate, and PowerApps. Along with Brainstorm I have completed several modules in Microsoft in learning Azure and learning PowerShell. As of 08/29/2022, I have completed 18 modules in Microsoft.learn. While learning, I was able to start an introductory class in Kubernetes and in PowerShell to learn commands. 

I was able to work on some shared projects as well. These were collaborative with many departments and I was able to work on some projects that were live and front end facing. 

•	The first project I worked on was a Power Bi Data set that took data from a SharePoint list and turned it into visuals. This was for the security credential login. The data showed how many people we checked in that year, the company they were with, the id type they used and how many people on average we had checked in.

•	The second project I helped collaborate on was a live app that helped security check in users. I was tasked with making certain badges display “No building access”. I was successful in this attempt and the project went live after they had me adjust some wording. This application checked in key and badges and I was tasked with creating an automation that would send the managers an email every night at midnight letting them know which key were still checked out

•	I collaborated on a project that involved employees asking for VPN access. I had to transform a Word Document into a Microsoft Form, then automate that form to make a new item in a SharePoint List, as well automate an approval. I had the form set up, the first part of the flow working and my supervisor was able to finish the rest of the flow while I was away.

•	I collaborated on another form automation. This one made one form into two forms and had the person fill out the second form after being approved by the manager for the first form. These forms were created off a premade questionnaire in word and were translated into Microsoft Forms. These forms were sent to the InfoSec director for final approval before allowing a company to have access to the VPN

Another project I was given was to make an outlook calendar auto add an event to the PTO calendar in events whenever someone used the words PTO. In basic terms, when someone would enter a calendar event into their outlook that contained the word "PTO", it was then added to a shared calendar called PTO and added to the calendar event.

 A PowerApp I helped work on was an app designed to use color codes to notify IT staff of a server outage. I helped create a pop-up that would let the user know the basic details of the node. This app was built by my coworker however I was able to help by creating some of the design elements for visualization. 

- I created a SharePoint List with all the users of an Active Directory group that had Microsoft licensing and helped to eliminate the licensing that was not needed in the organization in order to help reduce costs. I was able to find all the users, organize them by supervisor and then started to ask the supervisor what licensing they thought they really needed. 

-Created and design a PowerApp that allowed users to scan a barcode to enter that barcode into a repository. They would then be able to update that barcode and the owner as well as the category of the asset. The owner was found by creating a second screen in which the owner was searched via the database. This application was later modified to allow for asset tags and location fields as well as model fields. The repository in SharePoint was later automated to the TopDesk API. For this project  I created a power automate flow that turned a text column, copied it into a "person" column for lookup and email access

I completed all 95 exercises in Python on W3 schools. Created and practiced python throughout internship. I practiced basic exercises in python such as the calculator practice and other small tasks

I had help but created a PowerShell script that pulled Microsoft users with old domain logins to migrate those users to new domain. I was able to get a list of the user and was able to pull them to a text file that I was able to give to my manager. 

I created Hunting queries in Sentinel that found users that activated PIM after hours and then compared it to a change control board to find users who may not be properly activating PIM. This was then visualized in PowerBi and the file was shared with the InfoSec director as well as the cloud director. 

As a daily task, an expectatioon was that I investigate phishing tickets from users that reported it to Top Desk. After looking into the tickets, I would run the email through abnormal security and check the SPF,DMARC and DKIM. These helped me to determine the validity of the email address and whether or not to block the email in Microsoft Defender. After blocking the email address in Defender I would then move on to the next ticket. 

I worked on python script for masking credit card numbers. I was able to make the script pull numbers and hide them besides the last four.

As of 09/15/2022 I was able to complete 61% of the Azure 900 Fundamentals course in A Cloud Guru.
